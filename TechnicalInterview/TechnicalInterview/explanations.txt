Question 1
-----------
A map called letters is a map of all the letters in alphabet as key and prime numbers as value
The hash function converts a string to a hash value by adding corresponding prime numbers
So a string with characters in any order will have same hash value
The code loops through main string s to strip sub strings of same size as string t to compare their hash values
If the hash values are same then True or else False is returned
The code checks for error situations like string having None, empty or t having more characters than s
The code returns False for all error situations

Question 2
------------
Palindrom is initialized as an empty string
Given string a the code loops through all of its sub strings to check for palindrom
Once a palindrom is found it checks if its length is greater than the stored palindrom
If yes it sets the palindrom to new palindrom
The final value of palindrom is returned
